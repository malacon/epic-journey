You can simply use Javascript in order to add any HTML to the DOM and render a
page. The base markup you need is a script tag and a body tag. From there
you can access and edit the DOM using the document.getElementByID,
document.getElementsByTag, and the like to add elements to your page.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /\_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
